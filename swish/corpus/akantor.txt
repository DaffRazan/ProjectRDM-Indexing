The Akantor is a massive, vaguely snapping turtle-like wyvern that dwells in magma. Akantors are covered with massive reddish black spikes and durable shells, and have both large sharp claws on their legs but also a similar structure on its tail. The Akantor's most distinctive feature aside from its fearsome spikes are the pair of dreadful tusks on its head. These tusks are both nearly as long as the entirety of the head. The underside of the Akantor is a much tanner color than the rest of its body, and is comparatively lacking in dangerous protrusions.
